# Lindenmayer Examples

## Interactive 2D L-System Builder

This example features a simple GUI to construct an L-System that uses
the classic turtle graphic commands: + (rotate clockwise), - (rotate anti-clockwise), F (draw line), [ (start branch), ] (end branch).
It uses a web worker to schedule the calculation of the L-System results for smoother interaction with the user. ( [code](https://github.com/nylki/lindenmayer/blob/master/examples/tree.html)
